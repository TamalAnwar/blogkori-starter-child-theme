# BlogKori Starter Child Theme
A starter child theme for BlogKori

You should use this child theme for whenever you wish to customize your website running the BlogKori theme.

To download the parent theme, go to: https://wordpress.org/themes/blogkori/

After you download and install the theme on your website, download this child theme as a .zip file format and upload the theme just like a regular WordPress theme.

Activate the BlogKori starter child theme on your theme list.

When you need to make code changes to your site, say you want to add custom copyright text on your website footer, just edit the footer.php from your child theme. This way when a new version comes out of the parent theme, your customization will stay intact.
